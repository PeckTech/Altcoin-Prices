# Altcoin Prices

Altcoin Prices is the first and only FLOSS 
(Free Libre Open Source Software) GPLv3 licensed cryptocurrency 
portfolio management app for Android.  
Altcoin Prices does not rely on any central infrastucture, data are 
gathered directly and anonymously from public sources like 
cryptocompare, coinmarketcap, etc.  
Users data never leave the device, the app does not include any tracking 
or malicious library or component, both in its literal sense and as in 
freedom restricting.  
All the most important coins are supported and new ones are added every
week (or even day).

## Security

Altcoin Prices does not tracks its users in any way, data are fetched 
directly from cryptocompare using its API.
I encourage people to take a look at the code and report any bug or
security hole they can find.
